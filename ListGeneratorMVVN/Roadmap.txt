RoadMap

Todo:

? Dynamically add departments, department page 
+ proper department binding with input box / property value
+ date selector
- employee adding and deleting page
+ flow document preview
+ move errors to popup window
- reset input box state after properly adding input
? add save as pdf / export
? radio buttons for title page
? don't print empty departments
- Cleanup duplicate code for viemodelbase and RelayCommand

Bugs:
- resizing window with preview alters flowdocument properties // resolved with fixed size readerwindow


Optional:
- select all button for employees and departments
- print selected lists, print selected parts
- edit headers, title page?
- edit font size?
- add localization
